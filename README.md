# french-vocab-C-cheatsheet
Cheatsheet I created for my level C French oral exam

##
I have cloned [tim-st's](https://github.com/tim-st)
[latex-cheatsheet](https://github.com/tim-st/latex-cheatsheet) and
used it almost as-is (except for removing the content and replacing it
with my own).



## How to use
I have added a new LaTeX command:
```
\fr{french word}{word's french article}  {english definition}
```tex
It prints out:

`_word's french article french word_ = english definition

The french word is in italic


This allows me to sort words
